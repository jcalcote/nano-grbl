# nano-grbl
A KiCAD circuit board for embedding an Arduino Nano V3 and breaking out the I/O pins for GRBL.

This KiCAD project is a simple pcb allowing the embedding of an entire Arduino Nano along side minimal additional hardware for breaking out and labling I/O pins for the [GRBL](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) gcode interpreter software package.
